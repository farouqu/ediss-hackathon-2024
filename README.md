# EDISS 2024 Hackathon Project

This project was developed as part of a hackathon aimed at exploring the potential of vehicular and emotional datasets to quantify risk. Our main goal was to investigate whether the combination of vehicular data and emotional dataset from video sensors excluding EEG data could provide insights into risk assessment.

## Overview
In this repository, you will find the code, documentation, and resources related to our hackathon project. We focused on the following key tasks:

1. Data Collection and Exploration: We collected a dataset from the [SIMUSAFE project](https://www.mdu.se/en/malardalen-university/research/research-projects/simusafe-simulator-of-behavioural-aspects-for-safer-transport) from Malardalen University.

2. Data Preprocessing: To prepare the data for analysis, we performed extensive preprocessing. This involved cleaning the data, handling missing values, and formatting it for machine learning tasks.

3. Machine Learning Model Development: We trained machine learning models on the processed vehicular and emotional datasets. Our aim was to explore whether these datasets could be utilized to quantify risk.

4. Evaluation and Analysis: We evaluated the performance of our models and conducted an in-depth analysis to understand the relationship between the collected data and risk assessment.

## Key Question

Our primary question was:

Can the combination of vehicular data and emotional dataset from video sensors provide enough information to quantify risk accurately ?

## Acknowledgment

We would like to thank the organizers of the hackathon - [EDISS](https://master-ediss.eu) for providing us with the dataset, opportunity to work on this challenging problem and for the resources made available for the event. Special thanks to all contributors for their hard work and dedication during the hackathon.
